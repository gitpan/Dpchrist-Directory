NAME
    Dpchrist::Directory - utility subroutines for directories

DESCRIPTION
    This documentation describes module revision $Revision: 1.11 $.

    This is alpha test level software and may change or disappear at any
    time.

  SUBROUTINES
   dirdiff
        dirdiff DIR1,DIR2

    Recursively compares two directories DIR1 and DIR2, printing messages as
    differences are found, and returns a hash reference with statistics:

        {
            -ndifferences   => 0,   # number of differences
            -ndirs          => 0,   # number of directories
            -nerrors        => 0,   # number of errors
            -nexcluded      => 0,   # number of items excluded
            -nfiles         => 0,   # number of files
        }

    Options may be set via %Dpchrist::Directory::opt:

    -exclude => GLOBSPEC
            Skip files and/or directories matching GLOBSPEC.

    -fat => BOOL
            Use a delta time of 3 seconds when comparing file mtime's
            (for FAT filesystems).

    -ignoremtime => BOOL
            Ignore mtime when comparing files.

    -ignoresize => BOOL
            Ignore size when comparing files.

    -verbose => BOOL
            Print extra information during operation.

    Calls Carp::confess() on fatal errors.

  EXPORT
    None by default.

    All of the subroutines may be imported by using the ':all' tag:

        use Dpchrist::Debug         qw( :all );

    See 'perldoc Export' for everything in between.
